# My vision of Clean (onion) Architecture implementation

"Clean" (Layered) Architecture is another way to achieve <b>separation of concerns</b>, <b>encapsulation</b> and <b>decoupling</b>, by grouping code units based on their domain and functional role within the application. 

One of the main property of this architecture:
<b>We should never mix business-logik and application-logik in one service class</b>.
This is because it becomes practically impossible to separate the two logics once they are implemented (mixed) together.

## My view of implementing an Onion "Clean-Architecture" with Java (Domain-driven Design, 'Hexagon' architecture)

### Layer Structure:
- <b>Domain</b> Layer
  - All <b>business logic</b> is here (only fields and accessors and rules)
    - e.g. isPasswordIsValid(): 5 digits...
  - Private Entities, Events, Inner-Procedures(?) and public Aggregates
- <b>Application</b> Layer
  - <b>Separation of usecase-logik-methods from technical (low-level) service-help-methods</b>
  - <b>Use Cases</b> (<b>Interactors</b> with Domains: create Entity, findByName, 'as a role X, I except special behavior'...)
    - e.g. 'UserRegisterInteractor'
    - define DTOs (with other layers)
    - define own IGateway (technical interface-service-methods) 
    - injects und uses (low) implementation of own defined IGateway
  - It does not contain business-logic (=inner rules in Domains). But should contain interactor-logik (extern actions with Entities-Aggregates).
  - and we didnâ€™t use any spring annotation in our business.
- <b>Infrastructure</b> Layer
  - Implementation of IGateway (technical help-services, defined in upper layer)
    - e.g. 'JpaUserRegisterApplicationService'
  - The technical capabilities that <b>support</b> the layers above, ie. persistence or messaging.
  - MVC, interface adapters
- Extra "Main" (<b>Config</b>) Package
  - SpringConfig //as Martin Fowler describes in his book

### My differences to base article:
- My changes and corrections
    - 4 basic Layers ("Domain", "Application", "Infrastructure", "Main") for Project Package-Hierarchie 
    - I believe, Aggregates (DDD) should be an EntryPoint to Domain.Module (not just a Factory)
    - Domain-Entities should be not accessible outside of the domain Layer
    - Records (Java17) as valueObjects
    - <b>ArchUnit</b> for insuring DDD Onion Architecture Rules
    - Spring Config from "Main" layer injects DI Classes (architectonic border)
    - Inject Interactor as Boundary-Interface
